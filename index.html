Civics Unplugged chief product is the Civics 2030 community: a youth-led, digital-first community of exceptional Gen Zers leading a 10-year campaign to strengthen American democracy. This community is supported by a network of partners and supporters—like Senator Cory Booker, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, the Smithsonian, and National Geographic—who have committed to empowering these Gen Zers with mentorship, funding, opportunities, and other forms of support that can help them grow as leaders and create positive change.

The Civics 2030 community is powered by graduates of the Civics Unplugged Fellowship, a six-month civic leadership program that prepares hundreds of civic-minded high school students each year to become effective contributors to the movement to strengthen American democracy.</p>
